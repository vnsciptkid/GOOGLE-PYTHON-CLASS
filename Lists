- List in Python is quite similar with string
- Some similar things: 
  + also a built-in type 
  + Using square bracket [] to retrieve a element in the list 
  + Also using [a:b] to get a sublist from the list
  + Some built-in method like : len()
  + IMPORTANT: Assignment does not make a copy, but a pointer to the object, using id() to retrieve address of object
  + ""-> empty string . [] -> empty list
  + Using + to combine 2 lists , just like string
  
- FOR and IN
  + FOR/IN constructs have the same function as for in c/java but using different syntax
  + for var in list:
  + IN itself is a way to test if a element is appear in a list
  
- RANGE
  + range(100) yeilds number from 0 to 99, whereas range(a,b) return a list from a upto b but not including b
  + using RANGE in combination with FOR/IN to make a traditional FOR loop
  + Notice: keyword is case-sensitive, using lower-case in practice 
  
- WHILE
  + Syntax: while conditions:
  
- List METHOD
  + a.append(ele) : append a single element to the end of the list, modifying the original list, dont create a new list
  element here can be anything
  + a.insert(index, ele) : insert a element into a given index in the list, shift other elements to the right by one
  + list.extend(list2)
  + list.index()
  + list.remove(ele)
  + list.sort()
  + list.reverse()
  + list.pop(index)

- List Build Up
  + Start from empty list [] and using extend() or append() to build the list  
  
- List slices
  + Same as string
  + can be using to change a sub-part of the list
